# G2PML
ML based model of neuro-developmental disease genes (monogenic forms of the disease)

## Introduction
This is set of datasets and software tools to study monogenic diseases. We study the diseases through the genes already discovered to be associated to the disease in the __Mendelian__ way (i.e. one mutation, one case). These genes form what is known as a panel of genes. A gene belongs to a panel because there is enough evidence in the literature that associates the gene with the monogenic form of the phenotype. Panels can be form of either few genes (e.g. 3 or more) or hundreds, as in intellectual disability.

As we said, we study the disease through its gene panel. Therefore, any disease or phenotype that can be described through the genes associated to monogenic forms of the disease can be studied with this tool.
