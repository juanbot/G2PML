# G2PML
ML based model of neuro-developmental disease genes (monogenic forms of the disease)

## Introduction
This is set of datasets and software tools to study monogenic diseases. We study the diseases through the genes already discovered to be associated to the disease in the __Mendelian__ way (i.e. one mutation, one case). These genes form what is known as a panel of genes. A gene belongs to a panel because there is enough evidence in the literature that associates the gene with the monogenic form of the phenotype. Panels can be form of either few genes (e.g. 3 or more) or hundreds, as in intellectual disability.

As we said, we study the disease through its gene panel. Therefore, any disease or phenotype that can be described through the genes associated to monogenic forms of the disease can be studied with this tool. Our approach to the disease is by describing genes in terms of (a) genetic constraint related properties, (b) genomic related properties and (c) transcriptomics. 

With G2PML and your panel $P=\{g_1,g_2,...,g_n\}$ of choice, where gi is the i-th gene, you can

* Perform an analysis on which features are relevant to distinguish those genes from the rest

* Create prediction models to predict new genes from the set of P genes and annotate and score the predictions.

* Enlarge your DDBB of properties to incorporate new ones to enrich your analysis
